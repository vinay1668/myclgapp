       <p>
            My project is about building the social media web application specifically for my college
using node js and React js, where users are authenticated by college email id, so that we can be sure 
that he/she indeed is the person form our college. Username will be the registered roll no. If a 
person makes a post his username will be visible along with the post. User can post text, images,
videos, files(pdfs). There exists karma, which is the sum of votes of all the posts he made since he 
created the account
