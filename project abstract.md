# PROJECT ABSTRACT

 
#### This project is about building Forum specifically for my college using node js and React js, where users are authenticated by college email id, so that we can be sure that he/she indeed is the person form our college. Username will be the registered roll no. If a person makes a post his username will be visible along with the post. User can post text, images,videos, files(pdfs). 

### Initial Design:



<div />
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68241977/166889182-9fa5d25b-d328-43f6-a805-4e0c0cac015d.jpeg" height="500px" width="300px" />

</div>

#### Uses

#### 1. Can be used for announcements. (The post created by you is visible to everyone in the college, who have created the account in my application using college email id)

#### 2. Can be used to store data/images/videos/pdfs related to college events/activities for a much longer duration (decades into the future) and data can be retrieved easily using filters. Right now, there is no place for storing all the data related to college and that is accessible to everyone in the college. (There is Instagram for college, but it is very limited i.e,. only a single person can post and data is not organized, hard to retrieve past data and student opinions about the particular post.) This application can provide that ability.

#### 3. A community is stronger only if there is a efficient way of communication among its members. Using this applications students/faculty can share their opinions/thoughts /emotions immediately to everyone. If people like that, he/she will be rewared by upvotes and if people don’t like it , he/she will be penalized with downvotes.

#### 4. (The GameStop story — A group of retail investors on an internet forum called Reddit who raised the stock price by 1,700 per cent. r/wallstreetbets, r/antiwork ) Revolutions like this happen if people did something collectively! This application can be used to address problems, penalize wrong things and rewarding right things that are happening around us.

#### 5. A person who once studied in our college can still be in connection with the college using this application. He can know how the college is, and events that are going on, by seeing the posts. And he even can post about his/her carrer like type of job he is doing/ company etc., to motivate other students in the college.

#### 6. Poll can be used easily to know opinions of the students/faculty instantly.

#### 7. Any student/person can ask for help instantly regarding studies or other things, interestedpeople can respond in the comment section.

#### 8. Students can showcase their little projects/acheivements .They can find like minded people through out the college, if they want to collaborate to make a projects, organize events or to do something good (collectively)
